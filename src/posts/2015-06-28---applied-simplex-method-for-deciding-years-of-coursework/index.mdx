I am pursuing a Masters of Computer Science. Why? Because learning is **fun**, I
desire self-improvement, and because I can. I hope that the gains acquired from
the degree support
[my goal of servitude](http://cdaringe.com/about/#workphilosophy). This is not a
pursuit rooted in career-advancement. My motivation for learning drives my
proposed model's objective, generally dubbed `Z`, which describes the target
value I want to maximize at school. Before we can break down what `Z` is and the
components involved, allow me to set the context.

The trouble with beginning my masters program is that there are _many_ course
options. Within the program, there are various tracks (or specializations) that
a student may take. _Each student must select a track_. Each track has its own
subsets of course categories, generally comprised of inter-related courses.
Additionally, each category has minimum credit hour requirements for the courses
in the set.

To clarify, suppose the program offers courses `c1, c2, ... , c100`. `track1`
may require that you take at least one course from (`c1, c3` ) and at least one
course from (`c2, c10`). `track2` may require 2 courses from (`c2, c3, c30`),
and so on. There may be one course per category, or there may be 100 courses per
category. At my current school of enrollment, I have observed as many as four of
these categories falling underneath a single track. I have even observed track
catagories define rules that consume each other!

Consider a hypothetical `track3`. `track3` may represent a CS degree with a
speciality in robotics. Suppose `track3` has the following category set:

- `category_1`: take one course from (`c1, c2, c3`)
- `category_2`: take one course from (`c2, c4, c5`)
- `category_3`: take at least 3 courses from `category_1` & `category_2`. In
  this case, `category_3` is a composite category of `category_1` &
  `category_2`.

Add more courses and more category conditions, and you may begin to see that
even within a track, you can receive a very different education experience.

I want to take courses that I am most interested in. The objective variable, `Z`
will represent fun in school. Using a
[Binary Integer Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming)
(BIP), I suggest a model to assert that I get the maximum fun out of my selected
courses. I achieve this by modeling real school-imposed constraints in a basic
mathmatical form, as required by the BIP. The BIP consumes the over-arching
master's program constraints, the track & category constraints, and a _fun
rating_ (or _desireability rating_) for each course in order to find an optimal
solution using the
[simplex method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm).

Cool. Let's try it. Set the objective function:
`(Maximze) Z = c1*C1_DESIRABLITY + c2*C2_DESIRABILITY ... cN*CN_DESIREABILITY`
<br/ > where

- `Z` ~= integer representation of net-fun,
- `cX` ~= boolean indicator if I take the course named `cX`, and
- `CX` ~= numeric "fun" vaule of taking course `cX`

Build a set of constraints to model:

- take at least one track in the program
  - `track1 + track2 ... + trackN >= 1`
- take the required number of graduation credits
  - `c1*C1_CREDIT_HRS + c2*C2_CREDIT_HRS ... + cN*CN_CREDIT_HRS = 30`
- satisfy taking the # of courses required by _each_ track category
  - `c1 + c2 + c3 - 2*track1 >= 0`, meaning at least 2 of c1, c2, or c3 must be
    taken if track 1 is selected
- take sufficient _foundational_ courses to sasify overall program requirements
  - `c1 + c9 + c10 >= 2`, where c1, c9, and c10 are the foundational courses in
    the program

I now must generate a course-wise score system to feed the model. I'll keep it
simple and score all courses in 'fun'-ness, rated 0-5 (where 5 is good, 0 is
bad). Certain contributing factors are particulary difficult to model. For
instance, I omit scheduling, course availability, and professor influence when I
generated my _personal_ desirability ranking. These factors could all be
modeled, but I leave them out for simplicity. Accepting PRs :) Note that there
are some interesting things you can do with these factors. Applying sufficiently
large or low (negative, even) ranking points can force the algorithm to put you
in a course, or help you dodge a course entirely if at all possible. There are
limits on its ability to do this, but know that it is a _feature_ of this model.

Enter these into the Simplex algorithm, and allow it to hunt for a potential
solution! The actual model is very small, and
[can be viewed here](https://github.com/cdaringe/course-selector/blob/master/main.py).
After all was said and done, my model predicted that
[my interests](https://github.com/cdaringe/course-selector/blob/master/ex/my-courses.js)
fall most inline with the "Machine Learning" track, and assigned me the
associated courses to satisfy that path!

I tend to stick to javascript whenever feasible, however, Linear Programming
packages in the JS community lack Integer & Binary variable support out-of-the
box. Thus, I have implemented my solution in Python using the rad++
[Pulp](http://www.coin-or.org/PuLP/) package.
