I've been a regular contributor to [AmpersandJS](http://ampersandjs.com/) for the better part of the last year. I put most of my hours into improving the `FormView` and `FormFieldView` set of packages. I've landed other patches and features in the &-ecosystem too, but dialing in the form interface was key for me. It was a lot fun, mainly due to that fact that the &-yet crew is a smart, positive, fun-to-work-with group! Today is a big day! :) Glad to join the team.
