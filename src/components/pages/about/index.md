# welcome

Howdy! Thank you for taking the time to visit!  Please see the following the
sections to learn about me.

## professional life & recent history

I am an engineer in Portland, OR, currently employed as a

1. Fancy Titled Engineer at [WalmartLabs](https://www.walmartlabs.com/)
1. ~~Manager at [WalmartLabs](https://www.walmartlabs.com/)~~
1. ~~Senior Software Engineer at [Tripwire](https://www.tripwire.com/)~~
1. ~~Software Engineer at [The Mind Research Network](https://www.mrn.org/)~~
1. ~~Automation/Test Engineer
   at [LAM Research Corporation](https://www.lamrc.com/ "LAM Research Corporation")~~
1. ~~Manufacturing Engineer at Novellus Systems~~
1. ~~Industrial Engineer at [Intel](https://www.intel.com), Digital Health~~

I have been steadfastly engineering solutions to diverse problems since 2008! I
am privileged to have experience in software, mechanical, electrical, and
manufacturing engineering.

Education is a deep core value of mine. A strong foundation in academic
principles is an essential, defining characteristic of an engineer. I have
actively sought out technical knowledge and wisdom in my career, and have
achieved the following:

1. **MS Computer Science** (Georgia Institute of Technology, 4.0, 2018)
1. **BS Computer Science (equivalent, no capstone)** (Portland State University,
   3.8, 2014)
1. **BS Industrial Engineering** (Oregon State University, 3.92, 2010)
1. **BS Manufacturing Engineering** (Oregon State University, 2010)
1. **Business & Entrepreneurship Minor** (Oregon State University, 3.92, 2010)

My completion of the MSCS degree is a direct reflection of my existing expertise
and commitment to excellence in software design. I have a passion for the craft,
and want to produce the best quality work that I can.

I completed my Industrial, Manufacturing, and business certifications at
[Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/) back in 2010.  I finished
with honors, a 3.92 GPA, and two
successful [MECOP](https://www.mecopinc.org/ "MECOP") internships.  I was also
awarded
**[most outstanding senior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KeZ0OfJLZM "outstanding senior")**
in the college of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering.

## work philosophy

I strongly value the opportunity to work.  I believe that work is an
opportunity, not a chore.  I also believe that the most fulfilling work is that
which supports the community.  I have been privileged to receive an excellent
education and build an excellent professional support network, thus, I have been
able to work in jobs that I believe fulfill my 'community uplift' criteria.  I
do not regard many industries to be value-add, and in these sectors I hold no
professional interest.  Research firms, design firms, manufacturing firms, and
even consulting firms are where I believe value is generated for us as a
society. It is in these industries that I have worked and will continue to work.

## off hours

<a href="https://static.cdaringe.com/archive/2012/05/scanT.jpg" class="img-link"><img src="https://static.cdaringe.com/archive/2012/05/scanT-150x150.jpg" class="img-frame float-right" width="150" height="150" /></a>

Off hours, you will observe me most easily as a cyclist, as a geek, and
certainly as keeping
[Portland Weird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Portland_Weird). The sun
does not come out much in Oregon, but lack of sunshine has not deterred me from
a significant amount of road, mountain, and cyclocross riding.  I have been on
teams, clubs, and ridden independently.   I was previously heavily involved in
the [reprap](www.reprap.org "RepRap") community, building documentation, models,
firmware, & helping novices get their machines running. I still love to “wow"
students & friends with the simplicity of
[FFF](https://reprap.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication "FFF") printing. In
2013, I published my own printer design, including the full CAD and build
instructions under the
[OpenHardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware) philosophy.
Check out my machine, [cOssel](https://reprap.org/wiki/COssel)! Of course, as a
software geek, I spend a great deal of time
[hacking away on projects](https://www.github.com/cdaringe) as well. I was
previously active on the [AmpersandJS Core Team](https://ampersandjs.com/), and
still partner regularly with local advocacy groups, such as
[Portland Clean Air](http://pdxcleanair.org).
