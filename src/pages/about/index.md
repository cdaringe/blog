# welcome
Howdy!  Thank you for taking the time to visit!  Please see the following the sections to learn about me.

## professional life & recent history

I am an engineer in Portland, OR, currently employed as a

1. Senior Software Engineer at [Tripwire](https://www.tripwire.com/)
1. ~~Software Engineer at [The Mind Research Network](https://www.mrn.org/)~~
1. ~~Automation/Test Engineer at [LAM Research Corporation](https://www.lamrc.com/ "LAM Research Corporation")~~
1. ~~Manufacturing Engineer at Novellus Systems~~
1. ~~Industrial Engineer at [Intel](https://www.intel.com), Digital Health~~

I have been steadfastly engineering solutions to diverse problems since 2008!  I am privileged to have experience in software, mechanical, electrical, and manufacturing engineering.

Education is a deep core value of mine.  A strong foundation in academic principles is an essential, defining characteristic of an engineer.  I have actively sought out technical knowledge and wisdom in my career, and have achieved the following:

1. **MS Computer Science** (Georgia Institute of Technology, 4.0, 2018)
1. **BS Computer Science (equivalent, no capstone)** (Portland State University, 3.8, 2014)
1. **BS Industrial Engineering** (Oregon State University, 3.92, 2010)
1. **BS Manufacturing Engineering** (Oregon State University, 2010)
1. **Business & Entrepreneurship Minor** (Oregon State University, 3.92, 2010)

My completion of the MSCS degree is a direct reflection of my existing expertise and commitment to excellence in software design.  I have a passion for the craft, and want to produce the best quality work that I can.

I completed my Industrial, Manufacturing, and business certifications at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/) back in 2010.  I finished with honors, a 3.92 GPA, and two successful [MECOP](https://www.mecopinc.org/ "MECOP") internships.  I was also awarded **[most outstanding senior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KeZ0OfJLZM "outstanding senior")** in the college of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering.

## work philosophy

I strongly value the opportunity to work.  I believe that work is a fundamental and natural activity for daily life, *not* a habitual chore.  I also believe that the most fulfilling work is activity that lifts or supports the community.  I have been privileged with many blessings, including an excellent education and professional support network, thus, I have been able to work in jobs that I believe fulfill my 'community uplift' criteria.  I do not regard many industries to be truly “value-add” to our society, and in these sectors I hold no professional interest.  For example, the prospect of working for a toy manufacturer does not entice me.  Nor does working for a common financial institution, such as a bank.  Although these two example organizations may fill a reasonable demand, their output is not one that I see as truly beneficial to humanity.  Research firms, design/engineering firms, manufacturing firms, and even consulting firms are where I believe value is generated for us, both financially as a society, but also as a source of improving our quality of life.  It is here that I have worked, desired to work, and will continue to work.

## off hours
<a href="https://static.cdaringe.com/archive/2012/05/scanT.jpg" class="img-link"><img src="https://static.cdaringe.com/archive/2012/05/scanT-150x150.jpg" class="img-frame float-right" width="150" height="150" /></a>

Off hours, you will observe me most easily as a cyclist, as a geek, and certainly as keeping [Portland Weird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Portland_Weird). The sun does not come out much in Oregon, but lack of sunshine has not deterred me from a significant amount of road, mountain, and cyclocross bicycle riding/racing in the past 15 years.  I have been on teams, clubs, and ridden independently.   I was once heavily involved in the [reprap](www.reprap.org "RepRap") community, building documentation, helping novices get their machines running, and “wow-ing” middle-school students & friends with the simplicity of [FFF](https://reprap.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication "FFF") 3d printing.  In 2013, I published my own printer design, including the full CAD and build instructions under the [OpenHardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware) philosophy.  Check out my machine, [cOssel](https://reprap.org/wiki/COssel)!  Of course, as a software geek, I spend a great deal of time [hacking away on projects](https://www.github.com/cdaringe) as well.  I am an [AmpersandJS Core Team](https://ampersandjs.com/) member and I enjoy programming in NodeJS and the browser.
